in this Project I am assigned to implement an ETL process for my data that can be composed of different file types then load it in my data base where I analyse it and give my insights
This is a Sales & inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys ,I got it from Kaggle, 
it contains information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location.
